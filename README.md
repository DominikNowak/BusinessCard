The project was created to complete the first task of CodersCamp2020.
The main rules were to use only HTML and CSS/SCSS. The requirements also included the use of the following:

- Box-model
- Cascading CSS
- CSS selectors
- Popular HTML tags
- How to attach CSS to HTML
- Save colors
- Text styling
- External icons / fonts (fontawesome, google fonts)
- Flexbox and / or CSS Grid
- Position (absolute, relative)
- Keyframes animations
- Form
- Responsive Web Design

Template was created to be ready to add JS in next step, so form and mobile menu doesn't work properly yet. To see mobile menu there is need to add class 'navbar__menu--open' to ul element.
